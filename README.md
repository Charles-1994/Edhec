### ABSTRACT

Prediction of price for used cars is a topic thatâ€™s been in high demand because of the unprecedented number of cars being purchased not just from one owner to another but from companies and businesses that emerged especially to handle the sales and purchases of used cars. The primary objective of this research is to develop a Machine Learning model that would estimate and predict the prices of the used cars by using the features that are highly affecting our dependent variable 'price'. Data mining and pre-processing, and statistical analysis on this data were done with the help of the Data Science and Machine Learning libraries of Python. In this learning study, multiple regression algorithms were used from the Python Machine Learning libraries such as Sklearn, etc., to come up with a model that can be trained, tested, and compared to each other. Among all the models developed and experimented with, XGB Regressor had the highest score of 75% followed by MAE of $ 4083 and 93 % of MAPE. We expect to improve these scores if we consider even more relevant features such as description, model, mileage, and ML models prepared for company-specific cars. This study could be further developed into an application for mobile for the general public or for a firm that sells and buys used cars.
